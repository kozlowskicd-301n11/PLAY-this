# PLAY.this [i]

PLAY.this [i] is a card quiz game for a beginner coding developer.  A question or incomplete function will appear on screen, and a display of cards will be shown to the player.  The player selects one card, and if the card is correct it will spin to the slot on the right.  Upon answering the question correctly, the cards will clear out, a new question will appear, and new cards will deal out to the user.

## Getting Started

PLAY.this [i] will consist of three HTML pages and have human user interaction to select cards to answer questions. Furthermore, the other pages include a welcome HTML and about_us HTML. A general scaffold will be built on GitHub to have all team members utilize and work from the standard project template.

### Prerequisites

The developers will utilize Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to create the necessary code for the project. Additionally, VS Code will integrate with GitHub to manage the project successfully. 

Adobe Photoshop CC is required to develop all the card images and template for the questions. 

GIMP will provide quick service to the developer for adding text to the white side of the card and avoid time wasted with an online image manipulation app. 

Pixelmator provides the opportunity to work seamlessly with little downtime on OSX and png files to upload to GitHub.

### TODO

TODO -
* As a developer, I want to think of a name for the game 
* As a developer, I want to develop questions for the user to interact and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* As a developer, I want to create a wireframe with a placeholder of images to have the structure and foundation stable for adding content
* As a developer, I want to create a constructor for the questions that will convert them to objects and display it to the user by using object array for answers sorted by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* As a developer, I want to create a logic for checking the responses from the user input by checking the answer and matching if it is strictly equal
* As a developer, I want to create an event handler and event listener for the username and store it in a local storage.
* As a developer, I want to manipulate the DOM for listing the score and presenting it to the user as a correct choice or incorrect choice
* As a developer, I want to give the user three opportunities to complete the game without losing; however, if the answer is incorrect a red X will appear

### Installing

* The developer will create a wireframe of the game to assist with inserting images that will transform to a tally if correct. 
* The developer will create a nav menu to assist the user throughout the site.
* The developer will create all artwork for the images and provide up to 5 possible answers 
* The developer will develop constructors to recall the images of possible solutions (Answer). 
* The developer will incorporate a mobile solution to broaden the user base and attract unique users. 
* The developer will create an authentic card game that displays the functions of a physical card game. 
* The developer will create an about page with bio information about the creators and project mission.

## Running the tests

The developer will encompass a cornucopia of tests to obtain any issues with usability. Furthermore, the developer will scale this project if there is time allocated to include additional functionality and stretch goals.

### Break down into the end to end tests

Play.this went through several tests when displaying the cards because there were times that the code was misaligned and did not want to reveal the next question. However, utilizing a method of reload, was the answer to this specific situation. 

### And coding style tests

The code throughout the project consist of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS

## Deployment

Play.this has a live domain on Namecheap. the domain is play-this.io

### Project Name
PLAY.this [i]

### Concept
Develop a card quiz game for a beginner coding developer.  A question or incomplete function will appear on screen, and cards will be given to the player.  The player selects one card, and the card will flip to show if it is correct or incorrect.  Upon answering the question correctly, the cards will clear out, a new question will appear, and new cards will deal out.
