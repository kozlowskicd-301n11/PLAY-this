##### This template is split into three sections. 
* Part 1 Introduction to Play.this[i] and the goal
* Part 2 An educative encouragement on learning how to code
* Part 3 Guidelines for user and developer

##### The goal of Play.this [i]
Play.this provides an individual with a new method for recognizing and retaining vital information of basic elements and their meaning. Throughout the game, the user will experience a challenge and excitement by avoiding three strikes while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As young developers, the challenge is to learn programming and understand the concepts. Furthermore, understanding three different languages coherently may leave an individual running to another career. However, utilizing a game function that allows a user to focus and obtain those concepts will further their development into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##### An educative encouragement on learning how to code
Create a user-friendly site that the user may navigate to different pages and start the game to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while attempting to complete the game without losing. Overall the user will gain optimism in coding. 

##### Guidelines of user and developer
###### User
1. As a user, I want to navigate around the site from one page to another
2. As a user, I want my name to store somewhere and display on the game board
3. As a user, I want the cards to display in front of me and provide me the opportunity to answer correctly
4. As a user, I want a score for every question to tally and display on the game table
5. As a user, I want three opportunities to answer all questions correctly
6. As a user, I want an about me page to display the mission statement of Play.this

###### Developer
1. As a developer, I want to think of a name for the game
2. As a developer, I want to develop questions for the user to interact and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. As a developer, I want to create a wireframe with a placeholder of images to have the structure and foundation stable for adding content
4. As a developer, I want to create a constructor for the questions that will convert them to objects and display it to the user by using object array for answers sorted by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
5. As a developer, I want to create a logic for checking the responses from the user input by checking the answer and matching if it is strictly equal
6. As a developer, I want to create an event handler and an event listener for the username and store it in a local storage.
7. As a developer, I want to manipulate the DOM for listing the score and presenting it to the user as a correct choice or incorrect choice
8. As a developer, I want to give the user three opportunities to complete the game without losing; however, if the answer is incorrect a red X will appear
